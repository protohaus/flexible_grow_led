# Flexible Grow LED

This project is the result of SÃ¶ren Krusche's student research project.
The aim was to create a flexible LED light for growing plants with adjustable wavelengths.
It encompases the CAD files for the electronics and 3D printed components as well as the source code for the ESP8266 and the Node-RED flow.
